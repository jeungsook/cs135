### Download the pdf instructions for this exercise: [Download](https://github.com/jeungsook/cs135/raw/master/exercises/pdf/CS%20135%20Spring%202017%20Exercise%20%2311.pdf)

### Download the bubblesort handout: [Download](https://github.com/jeungsook/cs135/raw/master/exercises/pdf/CS%20135%20Bubblesort%20Handout.pdf)

### Tips
- Create functions for reading and writing files and reuse them in your future projects / homework.
- Remember that arrays are pass-by-reference by default

### Due Date Passed

Common mistates:
- Copy and pasting the bubblesort function directly without editing it to work with floats/doubles instead of integers
- Not setting the precision for the number list output to 1
- Not incrementing count correctly (setting it one too high)
