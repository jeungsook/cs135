### Tips
- **IF** the equation is quadratic (a is nonzero) and the roots are real (b2-4ac>=0), compute the root(s) and display them with 3 digits to the right of the decimal and labels
- **IF** the equation is not quadratic (a is zero), compute the root and display it with 3 digits to the right of the decimal and a label
- **IF** the equation is quadratic but the roots are complex (b2-4ac<0), then display a message stating that the roots are complex and will not be computed
- Keyword **IF**
