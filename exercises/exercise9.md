### Tips
- You MUST use the file Mrs. Misch provides
- All of the code you write (except to cout your information) goes between the brackets of the user-defined functions
- Write algorithms for your programs before you jump into them

### Due Date Passed

Common mistakes I saw were:

- Not checking both the height and width of the rectangle. If either one or the other is < 2, then the message should have been displayed
- Not printing out the triangle with the “right” justification (pun intended)
