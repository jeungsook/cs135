### Tips
- Do the problems by hand before you create a program to test your answers. These type of problems will most likely be on your first test, no matter who your professor is.
- Be careful when doing these. It's very easy to make a mistake / miscalculation.
- Your program will **not** output a decimal number if the answer has a zero decimal. Ex: 15.0 will print 15. Unless you use setprecision.
