- Use datatypes

### Due

### Point Value
20

### Download the pdf instructions for this exercise: [Download](https://github.com/jeungsook/cs135/raw/master/exercises/pdf/CS%20135%20Spring%202017%20Exercise%20%235.pdf)

### Tips
- Do the problems by hand before you create a program to test your answers. These type of problems will most likely be on your first test, no matter who your professor is.
- Be careful when doing these. It's very easy to make a mistake / miscalculation.
- Your program will **not** output a decimal number if the answer has a zero decimal. Ex: 15.0 will print 15. Unless you use setprecision.

### Due Date Passed:

The due date has passed. I know some of you have made programs to test your answers. I warned you about .0 output and if you came to me during lab or office hours I showed you how you can fix it with setprecision. Here is an exercise 5 code example with setprecision which prints out all of the correct answers.
