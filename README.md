# Welcome to UNLV CS135 Lab!

Hello! This page was created for the CS135 Lab sections 1004, 1005, 1017, and 1014 at UNLV but feel free to use it even if you aren't in my sections!

Here you'll find lessons on how to program in C++ as well as example projects for you to challenge yourself with! Complete code of all **practice** projects will be provided so you can compare your code to mine (I also provide tips for the graded exercises).

### GitHub

What is GitHub? GitHub (and more specifically, Git) is a version control platform / collabrative tool / social media platform for programmers!

I created this GitHub page so that even if you don't know how to use GitHub, you can easily access the lab information. But, if you're familiar with GitHub already, or curious, you can click the button in the header to see the GitHub repository of this page. 

In my repository you can access all of the files contained on this page and take a look at the page's code.
