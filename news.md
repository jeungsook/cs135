## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

## Newest Post:

### <a href="/cs135{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title }}</a>
**03/17/2017**

Exercises 10 and 11 have been released. Go get 'em (pdfs) while they're hot off the press!

This is my second news post today so check out the previous post if you missed it.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
