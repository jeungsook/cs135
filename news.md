## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

Hi, guys. I've been too busy to update the page lately but I do stay on top of anything concerning the graded Excercises.

Mrs. Misch extended the due date of Exercise 7 so I'm updating everyone on the new due date: Tue, March 7th.

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
