## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

So! I went over EX7, EX8 pretty thoroughly and broke down EX9 today. Did it help? Feel free to email me feedback. 

I put up the files for EX7 and EX8 that I showed you in class and their expected outputs. You can find them in their respective Exercise tabs at the very bottom.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
