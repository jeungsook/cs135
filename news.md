## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

## Newest Post:

### <a href="/cs135{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title }}</a>

**09/17/2017**

Exercise 3 has been graded. As always, let me know if you submitted & didn't get a gradesheet or if there's any issues.

I will grade Exercise 4 as soon as I can.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
