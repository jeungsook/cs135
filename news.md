## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

### <a href="/cs135{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title }}</a>
**09/06/2017**

I've posted my official office hours on the Home page. I'll be available in TBE B361 Mondays and Wednesdays between 12:00pm and 2:00pm if you need help with Exercises or Assignments.

I've also posted the next two Exercises - 4 and 5 under the Exercises tab.

Good luck!
