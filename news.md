## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

Exercise 7 is graded. As always: let me know before Wednesday if you did not recieve a grade sheet.

Also, Exercises 10, 11, 12, 13 are now posted. We'll be getting into some fun stuff like arrays, structs, filestreams, and functions.
Good luck on your exams!
