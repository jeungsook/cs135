## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

Important! The due dates for Exercises 11 and 12 have been extended.

Exercise 11 is now due, Tues, Nov 21 and Exercise 12 is now due Mon, Nov 27.
As always, email me if you're having trouble with either exercise.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
