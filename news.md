## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

This is not news. This is a test post to test the things that need testing in a way that the testiness of the testing material that is being tested will not give way to being testy due to testostorone because too much of that may test your ability to resist testocular illnesses. I would recommend getting re-tested.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
