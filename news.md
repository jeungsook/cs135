## Keep up-to-date with everything that's going on in the lab!

Here is where I'll post new information concerning the lab. For example: when I finish grading your exercises and when you can expect to recieve them, if the due dates for exercises change, etc...

I uploaded a new practise program. It's a game called Mastermind. It should provide a good end-of-CS135 challenge.
Read the rules carefully and let me know if you need more input to test your program.

## Old Posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% unless forloop.first == true %}
      {{ post.date | date: "%m/%d/%Y" }} - <a href="/cs135{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
