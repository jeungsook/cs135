**03/04/2017**

I've finished grading Exercise 6. Like always, if you did not get an email from me with your grade, I did not receive your Exercise. 
If you submitted the Exercise before the deadline and still did not receive a grade, please forward the email that you sent (through bobby) to me.

Common mistakes I saw were: 

- Showing two answers when the derivative = 0. You should check for this case and only show one answer. Worse is not showing an answer at all for that case.
Square root cannot be negative (without getting into complex numbers) but it most definitely can equal zero.

- Missing either the comment at the top of your program or output. 
Look, I know it's annoying but I **have** to take points off if you're missing these. Just assume from now on that **every** single Exercise is going to ask you to have your full name, lecture #, lab #, and Exercise # in these three places: 

1. As a comment at the top of your program. (You can have another comment block about your program Ex: This is a program that does ... It's expected inputs are ... and it outputs ... etc but make sure you put it below this comment)
2. Printed to the screen via a cout statement before any other program output
3. In the subject line of the email you send to me (make sure the Exercise # is correct)

It might be a good idea to create a "template" file with the first two taken care of so you don't forget (just make sure to change the Exercise #!)
