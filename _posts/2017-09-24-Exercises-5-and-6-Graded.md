I've graded Exercises 5 & 6. As always, let me know if you didn't recieve a gradesheet.

Couple things:

About exercise 5: make sure you understand then instructions and follow them to the letter. Being precise is very important in 
Computer Science.

About exercise 6: despite my tips and warnings in lab, we didn't do so well on this exercise. This material might show up on your
next test depending on your professor so I'd make sure you know why you lost points if you didn't get a perfect score.
