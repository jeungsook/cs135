Exercise 2 has been graded! Remember to have a similar comment at the top of every program you write for this class from now on, otherwise
I have to take off points.

I sent an email about it because it's important but I'll restate it here: Please put the word "Question" somewhere in the subject line
of your email if you have a question for me. I'm getting hundreds of submissions across all the exercises so it's hard for me to pick
out questions if yours gets sent into a gradebox.
