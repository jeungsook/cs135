Exercise 10 has been graded. As always, let me know if you haven't recieved your grade even though you submitted it.

Common mistates:
- Not removing spaces
- Last word missing

Overall, I think everyone did well with following the Exercise's directions this time around (everyone had at least one user-defined function).
Keep it up for the last Exercise.

Enjoy your Spring Break!
