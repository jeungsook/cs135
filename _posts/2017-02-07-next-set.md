Exercise 6, 7, and 8 have been uploaded to Mrs. Lee Misch's website. I have also posted them here for anyone not in her class.

I will update the tips section of each Exercise as I get questions in the labs so you might want to keep an eye out on those.

On an unrelated note, this GitHub page now has a favicon. ;)
Please fav this page and keep checking on it. I asked Mr. John Kowalski about the projector and it looks like it won't be fixed anytime soon... :(
