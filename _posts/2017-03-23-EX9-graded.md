Exercise #9 has been graded. Let me know if you have any issues with your grade but, please read the following before you do.

Common mistakes I saw were:

- Not checking both the height and width of the rectangle. If **either one or the other** is < 2, then the message should have been displayed
- Not printing out the triangle with the "right" justification (pun intended)

A big one (but thankfully not common) was creating the program from scratch. Read the directions carefully from now on.

In my last news post, I mentioned the issue with submitting your Exercise in the 11:50-12:06am range.
Please start your programs earlier and ask me questions / come to the labs if you're stuck.
