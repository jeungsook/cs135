Well, that wraps up the last Exercise guys! You're almost there, keep up the good work!

Common mistates:
<sp>- Copy and pasting the bubblesort function directly without editing it to work with floats/doubles instead of integers
<sp>- Not setting the precision for the number list output to 1
<sp>- Not incrementing count correctly (setting it one too high)

I will put the test files I used for this Exercise under the Exercise 11 tab.

If you have any questions about your grades for any of the Exercises, please send them asap. 
I will be turning grades into the professors shortly.
