**02/11/2017**

This is the second news post I've posted today. I'd also been editing the previous news post several times throughout the day. Each time I debated whether or not I should post a new news post or just edit it.

I've been a bit worried that some of you might miss some news posts that you might be interested in.

To help remedy this problem, I've added an RSS feed to this GitHub page. If you have an RSS reader, it should make it much easier to tell when there's new news.
