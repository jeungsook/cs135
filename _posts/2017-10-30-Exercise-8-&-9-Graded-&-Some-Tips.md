Exercises 8 and 9 have been graded. A few things about these exercises:

- Remember to put a comment at the TOP of your program. I'm getting a lot of submissions without it.
- Remember that you need to convert the numerator or denominator when you're diving two integers into a double before you divide if you want the result to be a double.
- Averages should always be a double / float - there's no gurantee that the numbers will divide evenly.
- Please read the directions carefully, especially whether or not you need to use input / output streams or Linux redirection.
