I've finished grading Exercise 7. Like always, if you did not get an email from me with your grade, I did not receive your Exercise. 
If you submitted the Exercise before the deadline and still did not receive a grade, please forward the email that you sent (through bobby) to me.

Note: I always wait a day before sending Exercise scores to the professors in case you guys have any questions or issues about your grade. 
Please send any questions about your grade in within a day of recieving your grade if possible.

Overall, we didn't do so hot with Exercise 7. I will go over it briefly next lab before going over Exercise 8 & 9.
