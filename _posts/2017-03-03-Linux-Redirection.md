I've gotten a couple questions about Linux Redirection so I made a lesson about it to clear up any confusion you guys might have.

Be sure to try out what I suggest in the lesson with your Exercise 6! It won't take long.

One more thing! If you have a question about the Exercises, please send it in an email with a subject line like "Question about Exercise #" or something like that.

Anything is OK really except subjects that are exactly like Exercise submission subjects (name, lec #, lab # etc...). I will immediately put these submissions into my corresponding Exercise folder until I'm ready to grade that Exercise and I will most likely not see it or see it only when it's too late.

That's why it's also important to have the correct Exercise number in the subject line. I will put it in the wrong folder (although I do try my best to check for that).
